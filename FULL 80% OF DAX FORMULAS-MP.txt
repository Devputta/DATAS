FULL 80% OF DAX FORMULAS

First DAX FORMULAS 
DAX is language that used to calculate tings in Power BI(Power PIVOT) DAX full form "DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSIONS"

Total Amount = sum(shipments[Amount]) ---> it will Calculate the total amount of each product in shipment table and another one this is if u put amount in column chart it will automatically sum the entire amount of each product (auto calculative)

Y do we NEED DaX

in dax it will calculate explicitly 
in auto it will calculate implicitly 
in dax we can name any thing as title 
in auto we can't do that

Measure VS. Columns 

what ever i measure using dax it will not add any extra columns in original dataset 
it will only act as a temporary columns 

MORE DaX FORMULAS

Shipment Count = COUNTROWS(shipments) --> it will count the number of shipment in each product
