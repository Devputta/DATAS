FULL 80% OF DAX FORMULAS

First DAX FORMULAS:
DAX is language that used to calculate tings in Power BI(Power PIVOT) DAX full form "DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSIONS"

Total Amount = sum(shipments[Amount]) ---> it will Calculate the total amount of each product in shipment table and another one this is if u put amount in column chart it will automatically sum the entire amount of each product (auto calculative)

Y do we NEED DaX:

in dax it will calculate explicitly 
in auto it will calculate implicitly 
in dax we can name any thing as title 
in auto we can't do that

Measure VS. Columns:

what ever i measure using dax it will not add any extra columns in original dataset 
it will only act as a temporary columns 

MORE DaX FORMULAS:

Shipment Count = COUNTROWS(shipments) --> it will count the number of shipment in each product 

DaX VS. EXCEL FUNCTION:

Pattern is same but some of few key function only  

Evaluation Context: 
 
it is very important to understand what is going on in screen or visual (Evaluation context is happing behind the screen or measure) 

Lets get started:

Shipment Count = COUNTROWS(shipments) --> it will count the number of shipment in each product
Total Boxes = SUM(shipments[Boxes]) --> this shows the total boxes of each product  

Measures Reusability:

Boxes Per Shipment = [Total Boxes] / [Shipment Count] --> here we are reusing the calculated column to count Boxes per shipment 
Amount Per Shipment = DIVIDE([Total Amount],[Shipment Count]) --> it is another way of doing division 
Calculate Function --> Bar Amount = CALCULATE([Total Amount], people[Sales_person]="Barr Faughny" ) --> it will calculate the total amount of Barr Faughny this person 
Bar % = DIVIDE([Bar Amount],[Total Amount]) --> ths will convert this numbers in to percentage 
Barr Bar amount = CALCULATE([Total Amount], people[Sales_person] = "Barr Faughny", products[Category] = "Bars") --> this will shows the total amount of Barr Faughny this sales person and Bars this category (this is a filter)
BBA in Mar2 = CALCULATE([Barr Bar amount],'calendar'[Year] = 2024,'calendar'[Month_num] = 3) --> this was the home work this shows the total amount of particular in the month 3 of year 2024
Total Amount (My Team)2 = CALCULATE([Total Amount], people[Sales_person]="Barr Faughny" || people[Sales_person]="Beverie Moffet"|| people[Sales_person]= "Ches Bonnell" || people[Sales_person]= "Husein Augar") --> this show the some amount generated by group of people as team 
or another way is
Total Amount (My Team) = CALCULATE([Total Amount], people[Sales_person] in {"Barr Faughny", "Beverie Moffet", "Ches Bonnell", "Husein Augar"}) --> this is a same but using in operator 
TC V1 = IF([Total Amount]>[Sales Target], "Yes", "No") --> condition function 
TC V3 final = IF([Total Amount]>2500000, "⭐⭐⭐", IF([Total Amount]>2250000, "⭐⭐", IF([Total Amount]>2000000,"⭐" ,"🛑"))) --> this is the best example for nested if condition function

ACMBU --> v. important

A --> Acquire Business knowledge 
C --> Clean Data
M --> Model
B --> Blocks Not Black Box
U --> DaX Query View or Use Variables
