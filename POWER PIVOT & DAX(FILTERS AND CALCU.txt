POWER PIVOT & DAX(FILTERS AND CALCULATE)

get started 

select data table which u want to measure 

right click on table --> new measure --> then it will appear 
 
formula for total --> total = sum(table name [column name]) then hit enter 
example ---> Total Boxes = sum(sales[Boxes])  (total number of boxes measure)

shipment measure in sales --> each row in sales is a shipment (means 1 row is 1 shipment)
example ---> Shipment Count = COUNTROWS(sales) (countrows is used to count the total numbers of rows in a table)

dax measures are RESUABLITY 
example --> Amount Per Shipment = [Total Amount]/[Shipment Count] or APS = sum(sales[Amount]) / countrows(sales)

Build Once use anywhere 
if function I DAX
Example --> APS Target Achieved? = IF([Amount Per Shipment]>4800, "YES","NO")  (name of the column = if(column > 4800, true, false)
fun tricks ---> APB Target Achieved? = IF([Total Amount]>4800, "ðŸ˜Š","ðŸ˜“") 

Count Of Product = COUNTROWS(products) --> this is kind Grouping alike in SQL (we have grouped sales person with product of their own)
Count Of Product(R) = DISTINCTCOUNT(sales[Product]) --> this shows the how many product have been they own
Low Box Shipment Count = CALCULATE([Shipment Count], sales[Boxes]<50) --> it will calculate or filters the below of 50 boxes of each product shipment count or (it means how much in each shipment count have been sold less then 50 boxes)
LBS % = DIVIDE([Low Box Shipment Count], [Shipment Count])---> it shows the how much % of low boxes shipment has done 
BAR Shipment = CALCULATE([Shipment Count], products[Category] = "Bars")---> it will shows the how many product bar(category) shipments has done in each shipment count
BAE shipment % = DIVIDE([BAR Shipment],[Shipment Count])



formulas:

APB = [Total Amount] / [Total Boxes] it will count amount per each boxes in sales table 
Another way is to use divide function for example APB2 = DIVIDE([Total Amount], [Total Boxes], "No Boxes") (Amount Per Boxes 2 = Numer, Deno, Alter)
