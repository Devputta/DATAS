POWER PIVOT & DAX(FILTERS AND CALCULATE)

get started 

select data table which u want to measure 

right click on table --> new measure --> then it will appear 
 
formula for total --> total = sum(table name [column name]) then hit enter 
example ---> Total Boxes = sum(sales[Boxes])  (total number of boxes measure)

shipment measure in sales --> each row in sales is a shipment (means 1 row is 1 shipment)
example ---> Shipment Count = COUNTROWS(sales) (countrows is used to count the total numbers of rows in a table)

dax measures are RESUABLITY 
example --> Amount Per Shipment = [Total Amount]/[Shipment Count] or APS = sum(sales[Amount]) / countrows(sales)

Build Once use anywhere 
if function I DAX
Example --> APS Target Achieved? = IF([Amount Per Shipment]>4800, "YES","NO")  (name of the column = if(column > 4800, true, false)
fun tricks ---> APB Target Achieved? = IF([Total Amount]>4800, "ðŸ˜Š","ðŸ˜“") 

Count Of Product = COUNTROWS(products) --> this is kind Grouping alike in SQL (we have grouped sales person with product of their own)
Count Of Product(R) = DISTINCTCOUNT(sales[Product]) --> this shows the how many product have been they own
Low Box Shipment Count = CALCULATE([Shipment Count], sales[Boxes]<50) --> it will calculate or filters the below of 50 boxes of each product shipment count or (it means how much in each shipment count have been sold less then 50 boxes)
LBS % = DIVIDE([Low Box Shipment Count], [Shipment Count])---> it shows the how much % of low boxes shipment has done 
BAR Shipment = CALCULATE([Shipment Count], products[Category] = "Bars")---> it will shows the how many product bar(category) shipments has done in each shipment count
BAE shipment % = DIVIDE([BAR Shipment],[Shipment Count]) --> it will shows the bar shipment percentage 
Americas shipment = CALCULATE([Shipment Count], locations[Region] = "Americas") this shows the shipment count of particular regain = Americas ( and this also overrides the filter in power bi application 

ADDING COLUMNS WITH DAX --> DAX is not only used for new measure it also include the adding features into a columns like table tools
Adding columns like weekdays amount -> which tells u that what is the amount is generated or revenue in weekdays 

Weekdays = WEEKDAY(sales[Date])--> it will tells u that how many weekdays are there in numbers from 1 to 7
row context --> *******
Friday Amount = CALCULATE([Total Amount], sales[Weekdays] = 6) --> it will shows the amount of particular weekdays like for example Friday 6 which means Sunday is 1
Another way to write a calculate 
Friday Amount 2 = [Total Amount](sales[Weekdays]=6) --> with out mansion calculate it will tell u to do calculate it is updated version form or another short form instead of longer format  

VARIABLES IN DAX
AZAU Sales Amount = 
    var NZAmount = CALCULATE([Total Amount], locations[Geo] = "New Zealand")
    VAR AUAmount = CALCULATE([Total Amount], locations[Geo] = "Australia")
RETURN
    NZAmount + AUAmount
this will tells u that it will add 2 region amount i single column using variables lie var and return and another way of doing the same calculation 

AUAZ Sales = CALCULATE([Total Amount], locations[Geo] in {"New Zealand", "Australia"}) --> this is short way but confusing 

formulas:

APB = [Total Amount] / [Total Boxes] it will count amount per each boxes in sales table 
Another way is to use divide function for example APB2 = DIVIDE([Total Amount], [Total Boxes], "No Boxes") (Amount Per Boxes 2 = Numer, Deno, Alter)
